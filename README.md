Here you will find the current version of my `.emacs` and `.latexmkrc` file.
I use `emacs` for `LaTeX` and programming in `C++` so my `emacs` initialization
file will reflect this nature.
My `.latexmkrc` is set up to have `Latexmk` run the appropriate amount of times
for a given `LaTeX` project and to utilize the `pythontex` package.
All packages were installed with <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<kbd>package-list-packages</kbd> through `melpa`.

Anyone is more then welcome to use all or part of my initialization file.
