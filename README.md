Here you will find the current version of my `.emacs` file.
I use `emacs` for `LaTeX` and programming in `C++` so my `emacs` initialization
file will reflect this nature.
All packages were installed with <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<kbd>package-list-packages</kbd> through `melpa`.

Anyone is more then welcome to use all or part of my initialization file.
