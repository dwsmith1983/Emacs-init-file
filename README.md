Here you will find the current version of my `.emacs` and `.latexmkrc` file.
I use `emacs` for `LaTeX` and programming in `C++` so my `emacs` initialization
file will reflect this nature.
My `.latexmkrc` is set up to have `Latexmk` run the appropriate amount of times
for a given `LaTeX` project and to utilize the `pythontex` package.
The `Latexmk` setup was courtsey of [Harvey Mudd College](http://mirror.hmc.edu/ctan/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles/pythontex-latexmkrc) and [G. Poore](http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/10742/g-poore) who
fixed an issue with the setup on [TeX.SE](http://tex.stackexchange.com/) at
the following post:
[http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/241773/pythontex-trying-to-compile-an-example-i-found-on-tex](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/241773/pythontex-trying-to-compile-an-example-i-found-on-tex)

All `emacs` packages were installed with <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<kbd>package-list-packages</kbd> through `melpa`.

Anyone is more then welcome to use all or part of my initialization file.
